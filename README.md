Hey!  
I'm Dakota, an aspiring Web3 security researcher based in the United States.

Over the past 6 months, I’ve been learning smart contract development from the ground up — primarily using Solidity and Foundry.  
I'm currently studying through Cyfrin Updraft's courses and pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity.

My long-term goal is to help make security a foundational part of how we build in Web3 — not an afterthought.  
As more companies move toward decentralized systems, I hope to help bridge the gap between traditional security principles and the unique challenges of blockchain-based development.


### Interests

- Smart contract security & auditing  
- Ethereum, Solidity, Foundry  
- Protocol design & on-chain risk analysis  
- Exploring the overlap between Web2 and Web3 security models


### A Few Extras

- Coffee ☕️ ✅
- Big fan of the outdoors — motorcycles, biking, hiking, fishing
- Dogs > Cats
- Enjoy gaming and reading fantasy
- Love watching tv shows with the wife
