Hey there 👋  
I'm Dakota, an aspiring Web3 security researcher based in the United States.

Over the past 6 months, I’ve been learning smart contract development from the ground up — primarily using Solidity and Foundry.  
I'm currently studying through Cyfrin Updraft's courses and pursuing a Master’s in Cybersecurity.

My long-term goal is to help make security a foundational part of how we build in Web3 — not an afterthought.  
As more companies move toward decentralized systems, I hope to help bridge the gap between traditional security principles and the unique challenges of blockchain-based development.

### A Few Extras

- Coffee = required fuel  
- Big fan of the outdoors — mountain biking, hiking, fishing, motorcycles  
- Always learning, always improving — one commit at a time

Thanks for stopping by. I'm still early in the journey, but committed to doing the work — and doing it the right way.
